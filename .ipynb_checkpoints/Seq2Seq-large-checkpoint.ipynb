There were also several unauthorized charges which included : XXXX monthly passes purchases, random locations based out of XXXX XXXX, NY, and several other unknown purchases. All of my identification and checks were lost including drivers license and social security information. I had to replace everything. Moving forward, I purchased a house for myself, spouse, and children in XXXX and became ill due to complications as a XXXX XXXX XXXX. Therefore, I was XXXX XXXX in the Spring of XXXX by the Department XXXXf Veteran 's Affairs. During this process, I ordered my credit report because of the denial of credit application. I discovered that there were numerous fraudulent charges that I was unaware of. I contacted Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX about these charges. Sending requests to dispute, these fraudulent charges, these accounts had already been sold. Despite this I sent I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXt, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX because they were the charges that I did not authorize and had no knowledge. I reached out via certified mail and telephone correspondence. I received a letter XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX that stated- unable to locate an account. I completed a police XXXX for transactions. Despite writing letters to XXXX and XXXX on XXXX, XXXX. I have yet heard back from XXXX or XXXX as these accounts have been sold. Per Equifax, I submitted my police report information and FCRA 605b, identification for verification of identity. There has been no resolution. I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX with my no signature or contract. After three months of writing letter, there is no validation or attempts to reconcile this injustice. Equifax refuses to correct this injustice and I have complied with all requests to get the issue resolved. I am reaching out to your agency for assistance because I have diligently worked to remove fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I can not risk or afford for my credit to be impacted in such a negative manner when the transactions were not authorized and can not be validated by the debt collectors. \n",

And make them evict the apartment. After the process was completed, I was required to pay attorney fees for the grant. I reminded them that I have no income and that I have capitulations with my husband. Then I demanded original capitulations what I could not send because then I could not recover them. The lawyer who made them no longer lives in PR and can not do anything for me. The bank was harassed because it saw my husband 's income on the statement.

      "I am a victim of banking fraud through unauthorized wire transfers by scammers who posing as potential employers beginning XX/XX/XXXX. The scammers used stolen identities via other people 's banking accounts to pay me for goods totaling {$52000.00}. These purchases of which {$33000.00} was through XXXX and the other amounts of {$18000.00} was through a Citibank Home Depot credit card. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was told by the scammers the accounts were in my name through a company business account setup to pay for goods they were paying me to buy. I believed that the payments given by the scammers were valid after testing the first {$1000.00} in XXXX. I proceeded to make more purchases with the information to wire transfer payments from company account to my account through accounts given. \n",

The XXXX bank contacted me by XX/XX/XXXX ; well past 30 days, after the stolen payments paid to me for the goods began returning as unauthorized transfers as of this time XXXX had authorized {$26000.00} and Citibank {$18000.00}. By the beginning of XXXX after purchases of goods were completed and all invoices paid off. Except the last purchase for {$7900.00} which would have marked the end of my so-called probation time with the scammers the total purchases was {$51000.00}. The company was to let me know if they would hire me, it was at this time payments the banks confirmed valid began returning as unauthorized. The timing of these payments returning makes me believe that the owners of the stolen banking information may be involved in the scam. \n",

      "\n",
      "In XXXX, XXXX after sending many resumes looking for work, a person name XXXX XXXX contacted me who I believed to be a legitimate employer this individual claimed to be a recruiter for the company. I filled out an application to be possibly employed after what they called a probationary time. They claimed an evaluation for employment with them would be completed after they see how well I could purchase and ship goods based on their specifications. They said they would pay for my purchases and shipping cost which they did via External Wire Transfers of funds. \n",
      "\n",
      "They asked me to fill out an application for information that a legitimate employer would and I being skeptical did an online search of the company on link they provided with the responses showing the company to be at least at the time a valid entity on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX. This however turned out to be false and a fraudulent company which I found out after payment funds returned and I purchased and shipped the goods. They reimbursed me for all my expenditures from what I have learned were another persons stolen bank account funds. \n",
      "\n",
      "The problem with all these transactions lies with three banks, whose job it was to flag the fraudulent transactions before they ever approached paying my account. Because the banks began paying, it aided the scammers to increase purchases to a current total of {$52000.00} which has overdrawn my credit limits. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of XXXX all fraudulent payments had been returned unauthorized. Failure by these banks XXXX, Citibank and XXXX XXXX XXXX the bank where all the accounts were stolen from by the scammers ) began when they allowed many supposed external wire transactions accounts funds purportedly in my name as claimed set-up by the phony import/export company, into my personal account. One bank explained to me that they pay on the bases of blind trust that the payment may not be fraudulent. They didnt verify who the account belonged too before giving a confirmation number and transferring the funds to my account. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore after my first {$1000.00} that XXXX XXXX sent me for payment with a confirmation number XXXX and Citibank confirmation number XXXX ; here lay the first problem because, I believed they verified the account holder name was a business account authorized with my name. The bank confirmation meant to me that it was a valid account and I proceeded to make more purchases because it indicated that the scammers unauthorized bank transactions were valid. \n",
      "\n",
      "The phony import/export job I was trying to get hired for, as I have learned had some XXXX XXXX XXXX man, from Florida, and a dental office as the actual stolen bank accounts holders for XXXX XXXX   phony company transfers. I was told it was a dental office that alerted the bank, a month later that banking information had been stolen. \n",
      "\n",
      "If this were the actual case, then when XXXX XXXX and Citibank, contacted XXXX XXXX about external wire transfer funds from ; a supposed account set-up in my name by phony company, the account should have been automatically flagged as a suspicious transaction, with both parties, I and account holder being notified. \n",
      "XXXX and Citibank have paid my account on as stated by Citibank on XXXX trust before verifying, had they did their due diligence to verify the persons name ( s ) on the external wire transfer account they would have seen the very glaring problem that the account number and names do not match up and stopped this scam immediately from progressing. \n",
      "\n",
      "If these banks are willing to take these types of risks with my accounts then I the XXXX consumer should not have to bail them out and pay. The problem is the bank only wants to focus on the purchases ; I made only because of their confirmations, and not consider the stolen bank accounts that they gave bogus confirmation as valid, which then allowed bogus payments to overdraw my account this cant be ignored. \n",

XXXX XXXX has locked me out of my saving stating they are allowed to take all my funds to pay in addition they have began billing me for the fraudulent funds that have overdrawn my VISA account also sending me past due notices that payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX.

      "I believed how external wire transfers work is they ( the Bank ) verifies both parties sender and receiver before confirmation of payment.

      " My Husband and I refinanced our home in XX/XX/XXXX. At that time our yearly taxes were becoming due ( always paid by previous mortgage company XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. ). Funds had been built in to our new loan to start a new escrow account, as well as the complete funds to pay the taxes that were now due. The mortgage company that had our new loan paid our XX/XX/XXXX taxes on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$3600.00} to XXXX XXXX, Tax Assessor-Collector ( check written by XXXX XXXX ). Immediately after this payment had been made our new loan was sold to RoundPoint Mortgage Company. Our first payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$960.00}. At this time my Husband and I went online every month to RoundPoint 's website and made our monthly payment in a timely manner. However, when I went to make the XX/XX/XXXX payment I was shocked to see that our payment had increased by {$310.00}. I immediately called the contact number on their website ( I was routed overseas for every phone call ). and tried to explain there was a problem. I was told there was an escrow shortage because my taxes had been paid in XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$3600.00}. I tried explaining on two separate phone calls there was a problem and I needed to talk with someone in the tax department. I was told my concerns were being sent to the correct department by email and that someone would reach out to me. I also was forced to make this large payment. I also went online to the website and sent two emails explaining the problem and asking for a phone call, back from someone in the states to handle this problem, since there was always static and extreme background noise when calling customer care which was always routed to an overseas call center.. I never received a call back from my initial phone calls to customer service and I only received one form letter response to the two emails I sent. Finally, I contacted our mortgage broker and he said he would put me in touch with a customer liaison ( I contacted him on XX/XX/XXXX, he responded by email on XX/XX/XXXX and was very concerned that my taxes had appeared to have been paid twice! On XX/XX/XXXX I again contacted my broker and said that I had still not received an email or phone call from a representative at RoundPoint Mortgage.On XX/XX/XXXX a woman named XXXX left a message for me at XXXX and left her number. I tried calling her and leaving messages for 5 days and never received another call back.. On XX/XX/XXXX I again contacted my mortgage broker and explained what happened. By this time I had collected all information from tax office verifying they had made a tax payment when my taxes were already paid. The tax office said they could issue a refund to mortgage company they just needed mortgage company to contact them. I finally spoke with XXXX from Roundpoint and she said they were just starting to look in to the matter, even though I had already told customer service twice the problem and sent customer service two emails. Finally they admitted they had mistakenly paid our taxes and they adjusted escrow account. The problem now is we have yet to be refunded our {$310.00} over-payment we made on our XX/XX/XXXX house payment.. We have been told they are waiting to see if we will have an escrow shortage this year! I told XXXX that we want over payment refunded immediately, and to this day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) we are still waiting on OUR MONEY. I have enclosed correspondence from our mortgage broker, mortgage company and local tax office. \n",

The lender keeps dragging its feet and has one excuse after another as to why they ca n't or wo n't reference the XXXX Mortgage. At first they said the payoff XX/XX/XXXX released both liens because they both had the same loan number, MIN number and FHA case number. Now they say they do n't have the authority to reference a Discharge for the XXXX Mortgage even though they prepared the documents. The latest tactic is to blame the Registry because they require a release of both liens and they do n't think it is required.

I provided ALL supporting documentation to Experian which was sufficient evidence to remove ALL tradelines relating to XXXX. I provided the same information to XXXX and XXXX and they both removed the tradelines. Now, Experian is denying my right to dispute fraudulent and inaccurate information on my report!
